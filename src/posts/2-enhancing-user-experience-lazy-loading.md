Implementing **Lazy Loading** for images can significantly improve your website's loading time and overall user experience. This technique ensures that images load only when they enter the viewport, which reduces initial page load time, and saves bandwidth for users who don't scroll through the entire page.

Consider using Lazy Loading for:

- Image-heavy websites
- Portfolios
- Media galleries
- Long blog posts

Before implementing, consider: "Will Lazy Loading enhance the user experience?" If the content benefits from faster initial load times, then Lazy Loading is the way to go.

However, Lazy Loading might not be beneficial if your site relies on immediate image visibility for a good user experience. In such cases, ensure your images are optimized and consider alternative methods to improve load times.

Remember, the key is to balance functionality with performance to provide the best user experience possible.
